        <p>With over 85% of the search market share, Google is undoubtedly the most popular search engine. Additionally, Google captures
            almost <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share/mobile/worldwide">95% of mobile traffic.</a></p>
            <p>The large traffic potential makes Google a viable option when aiming to capture organic or paid search. The downside,
                of course, is almost everyone is competing for the same traffic.</p>

        <p>Bing, Google’s biggest contender, rakes in 7% of U.S. searches desktop searches but only 1.5% of mobile searches.
            This engine also powers Yahoo, the U.S.’s third-biggest search engine.</p>
        <p>Bing’s search pages look remarkably similar to Google’s, with the same categories and a similar white background,
            with blue links and green URLs.</p>

        <h2>3. <a href="https://yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a></h2>

        <br>
        <p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://yahoo.com/">Image Source</a></p>
        <p>Admittedly not the sleekest search engine interface, Yahoo! still manages to capture third place in our list, with just over
           <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share/desktop/worldwide"> 2% of the worldwide market share.</a></p>
        <p>Yahoo! is  <a href="https://yahoo.com/">powered by Bing</a>, so search results are incredibly similar between the two search engines. However, it's still an
            important search engine in its own right, with over 600 million total monthly users.</p>

        <h2>4. <a href="https://yandex.com/">Yandex</a></h2>

        <p>Russian search engine Yandex has roughly <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share/desktop/worldwide">2% of the worldwide</a>
            market share. However, it is the most <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share/desktop/russian-federation">widely used search engine</a>
            in its home country, with Google holding the number two spot. If you do business globally and are looking to reach Russian customers, there are a few things
            to keep in mind.</p>
        <p>For example, Yandex has many quality indicators or badges it can display alongside search results. One of the most prominent
            is the <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share/desktop/russian-federation">site quality index</a> or SQIwhich indicates
            how useful your site is to users.</p>
